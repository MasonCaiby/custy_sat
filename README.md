# A Customer Satisfaction Tool

### About
A handful of tools exist for quick, on-site customer satisfaction surveys and analysis. 
    All of these tools include a fair amount of capital overhead, either in the form of 
    hardware and software purchasing or a subscription based service. This project's goal is 
    to create an open source solution to customer satisfaction survey's that allow companies to
    quickly deploy a server, multiple survey devices, and view/analyze their results.
    
### Requirements
You'll first need to setup a postgresql server. The instructions and downloads for that can 
be found [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). You
should alter then save your configuration details in the config.json file.

You'll also need an internet connected server and an internet connected device for customers to 
interact with.
